On October 25, 2023, VMware released a security advisory for a critical vulnerability in vCenter Server (CVE-2023-34048). This vulnerability allows an attacker with network access to vCenter Server to execute arbitrary code remotely.

The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds write in the implementation of the DCERPC protocol. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted RPC packet to vCenter Server. If the packet is successfully exploited, the attacker can gain root access to the vCenter Server.
