IASME Cyber Baseline is a new international cyber hygiene certification scheme that tackles the basic, but critical, cyber security protection measures. The standard leads the way to offer global supply chains a standardised and respected certification to show that organisations have the critical cyber hygiene measures in place.

The IASME Cyber Baseline certification is a cost-effective way for businesses of all sizes to demonstrate their commitment to cyber security. The certification is based on the ISO 27001 standard, but it is tailored for the needs of small and medium-sized businesses.

To achieve IASME Cyber Baseline certification, businesses must complete a self-assessment and have their assessment reviewed by an IASME assessor. The assessment covers a range of cyber security topics, including:

- Risk management
- Information security policy
- Asset management
- Access control
- Data security
- Business continuity

If a business successfully completes the assessment, they will be awarded the IASME Cyber Baseline certificate. This certificate is valid for one year, and businesses must complete a re-assessment each year to maintain their certification.
